This directory contains the source code of the DGECS tool for exporting
circuits evolved with the HERA ga to a generic vhdl description, allowing
to reuse them in any design.
This root folder contains at least the following files / directories:

	data -> contains the main python logic
	dgecs.py -> can be used to launch the gui ($ python dgecs.py) 
	gui -> contains the pyQt gui code
	README -> this README
	vhd -> contains the template vhdl descriptions

To extend the tool for supporting new architectures / devices, simply
write the suitable data (in python) and template (vhdl) files.
