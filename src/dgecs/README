This directory contains the source code of the DGECS tool for exporting
circuits evolved with the HERA ga to a generic vhdl description, allowing
to reuse them in any design.
This root folder contains at least the following files / directories:

	data -> contains the main python logic
	dgecs.py -> can be used to launch the gui ($ python dgecs.py) 
	gui -> contains the pyQt gui code
	README -> this README
	vhd -> contains the template vhdl descriptions

The vhdl files generated by DGECS can be easily embedded in the reference
components, meant to be used with the Xilinx development tools, found at:

http://code.google.com/p/hera-prj/downloads/detail?name=dgecs_component_8bit.tar.bz2&can=2&q=

To extend the tool for supporting new architectures / devices, simply
write the suitable data (in python) and template (vhdl) files.
