The files in this directory are the sources for the genetic algorithm
used in the HERA project.
The code contains conditional compilation directives to support all the
architectures and FPGA supported by the HERA project. The sources can be
used within one of the supported Xilinx architectures, available on the
"Downloads" page of the project site:
	http://code.google.com/p/hera-prj/downloads/list

To make use of the code, unpack one of the architectures, open it with
the Xilinx development tools, and create a new software project.
